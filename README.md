# Taskmaster: Distributed Task Scheduler

A robust and scalable distributed task scheduling system designed to manage and execute tasks across multiple nodes.

## Overview

This distributed task scheduler provides a framework for scheduling, distributing, and monitoring tasks across a cluster of worker nodes. It aims to deliver high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization.

## Features

- **Distributed Architecture**: Schedule and execute tasks across multiple nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic task recovery and rescheduling on node failures
- **Scalability**: Easily add or remove worker nodes as demand changes
- **Priority Scheduling**: Support for task priorities and dependencies
- **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into task execution and system health

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskmaster.git
cd taskmaster

# Build the project
make build
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the scheduler node
./scheduler start

# Start a worker node
./worker start --scheduler-address=localhost:5000
```

## Usage

Basic usage examples will be added as the project develops.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

- **Scheduler**: Central coordinator that manages task distribution
- **Worker Nodes**: Execute tasks and report results
- **Task Queue**: Prioritized queue of pending tasks
- **State Store**: Persistent storage for system state and task information

## Project Status
